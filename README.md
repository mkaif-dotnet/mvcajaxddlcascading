MvcAjaxDdlCascading is a simple ASP.NET MVC project that demonstrates the use of AJAX-based cascading dropdown lists without Razor. The goal of this project is to dynamically populate related dropdowns (such as Country → State → City) based on user selection, using plain HTML views and jQuery AJAX for a smooth, responsive experience.

This is commonly used in forms where data fields are interdependent. The project follows clean MVC architecture and uses JSON responses to update the UI without full page reloads.
